## Overview

**dreamagent.art** is the official promotional website for Dream Agent — an anonymous surrealist art identity exploring symbolism, mythology, economic themes, and machine-assisted oil-style works.

The site is intentionally static, minimal, and performance-focused.  
It exists to present artwork without friction.

## System Architecture

dreamagent.art operates as a public-facing presentation layer.

Creation and structured workflow occur within:

### Origin OS

A creator-first operating system developed by CourDevelops that powers:

- AI-assisted image generation
- Structured prompt systems
- Collection management
- Drop preparation
- Publishing workflows

Origin OS handles creation.  
dreamagent.art handles presentation.

This separation ensures:

- Clean production workflow
- No exposed backend dependencies
- Fast global performance via Netlify
- Controlled release cadence

---

## Technology

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Static deployment via Netlify CDN

No public runtime database or server dependencies.

---

## Update Flow

1. Artwork is created and refined inside Origin OS
2. Final assets are exported
3. Optimized images are added to the static site
4. Site is deployed via Netlify

---

## Design Philosophy

- Minimal interface
- Dark atmospheric palette
- Art-first hierarchy
- Intentional restraint
- Subtle motion

The interface exists to frame the work — not compete with it.
